## Why did I make this website
I made this website because everytime im building a gundam for myself or my brothere I sometimes lose the 
instructions. I wouldnt be able to find the instructions so i would google them but they were bad 
quailty images and I couldnt see the instructions. I decided to make a website about this gundam instructions to help others in the same position.

## What did I learn during this semester
- I learned how to Add images
- Create a hyper links
- Make a slide show with working slides
- Make a box, make two websites in one repositories,
- How to write javascript
- How to align images and text
- Put text ontop of an image
- Link css and javascript to html
- Use make image buttons.

## Something I wish I knew was
I wish that I could learn more ways to code by myself and how to do more things without help like
writing javascript all on my own. Also how to write css & html all my own. Leearn to align
images and text and make a fully functional website are also things that I wish I knew.

## My next project will be about
My next project will be about SHFiguarts website. where you can order missing pieces from some of you're
othere fuguars that are made by SHFiguarts and order SHFiguarts and posing stands if you make 
photography, like to make cool poses with you're SHFiguarts or make stopmotion with you're SHFiguarts.
